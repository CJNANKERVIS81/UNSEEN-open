## Evaluating UNSEEN extremes
Requirements for pooling forecasts into the UNSEEN method are: 1. Ensemble member independence; and 2. Model stability. After pooling, model fidelity should be tested (to assess whether the simulations are realistic).

We previously developed tests to assess the ensemble member independence and the model stability, in addition to the model fidelity test of Thompson et al., 2017. Here, we will apply the methods to evaluate the UK February precipitation UNSEEN ensemble, with the aim to make the evaluation easily reproducible.
