Evaluating UNSEEN extremes
--------------------------

Requirements for pooling forecasts into the UNSEEN method are 1. Ensemble member independence (reference to other github -- not possible yet) 2. Model stability (reference to other github -- not possible yet). After pooling, model fidelity should be tested (are the simulations realistic? (reference to other github -- not possible yet)).

Here, we will apply the methods previously developed to assess the UNSEEN ensemble for UK february precipitaiton, with the aim to make it easily reproducible.
