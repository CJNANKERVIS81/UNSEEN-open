Evaluating UNSEEN extremes
--------------------------

Requirements for pooling forecasts into the UNSEEN ensemble are: Ensemble member independence and Model stability. After pooling, model fidelity should be tested (to assess whether the simulations are realistic).

We previously developed tests to assess the ensemble member independence and the model stability, in addition to the model fidelity test of Thompson et al., 2017. Here, we will apply the methods to evaluate the UK February precipitation UNSEEN ensemble, with the aim to make the evaluation easily reproducible.

Have a look at the [notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/esowc/UNSEEN-open/tree/master/Notebooks/).
