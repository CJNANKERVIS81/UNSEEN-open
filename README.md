# UNSEEN-open
Open, transferable and reproducible workflow for the UNSEEN method

# What is UNSEEN?
The UNprecedented Simulated Extreme ENsemble (UNSEEN, [Thompson et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00275-3)) approach is an upcoming method that exploits seasonal prediction systems to assess and anticipate climate extremes beyond the observed record. The approach uses pooled forecasts as plausible alternate realities. Instead of the 'single realization' of reality, pooled forecasts can be exploited to better assess the likelihood of infrequent events, which only have a limited frequency of occurrence in observed records. This method has for example been used to improve design levels of storm-surges in the river Rhine and to anticipate and understand heatwaves in China. 
   
A considerable limitation of the UNSEEN method is the big data crunching it requires and the limited accessibility of some of the forecasting systems that have been used. Recently, we applied this method to SEAS5 for the first time, with promising results for extreme precipitation over Norway and Svalbard. SEAS5 is a good dataset for the UNSEEN approach because it is freely available and has a high resolution and a large ensemble compared to global climate models. To make this approach more accessible, we propose to make an open, reproducible and transferable workflow for the UNSEEN method using the open access SEAS5 dataset on the CDS.
