    "\n",
    "In this project, the aim is to build an open, reproducible, and transferable workflow for UNSEEN -- an increasingly popular method that exploits seasonal prediction systems to assess and anticipate climate extremes beyond the observed record. The approach uses pooled forecasts as plausible alternate realities. Instead of the 'single realization' of reality, pooled forecasts can be exploited to better assess the likelihood of infrequent events. \n",
    "We will illustrate the application for February 2020 UK precipitation and the 2020 Siberian heatwave. \n",
    "\n",
    "February average precipitation was the highest on record in the UK: with what frequency of occurrence can February extreme precipitation events such as the 2020 event be expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Siberian heatwave has broken the records as well. Could such an event be anticipation with UNSEEN? And to what extend can we expect changes in the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of these kind of events?"
